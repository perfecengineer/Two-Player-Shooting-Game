Title: Two-Player LCD-Based Shooting Game with ATmega32

Description:

In this embedded system project, we will develop an interactive two-player shooting game using the ATmega32 microcontroller, an LCD display, and two pushbuttons for each player. One character is armed with a gun, and the other character's objective is to avoid being shot. The game will provide an engaging and competitive experience for two players.

Components:

ATmega32 Microcontroller: The ATmega32 serves as the central processing unit, managing the game logic and player inputs.

LCD Display: An LCD screen is used to visualize the game environment, display the characters, and show game-related information.

Two Pushbuttons per Player: Each player has two pushbuttonsâ€”one to move their character and the other to control their character's actions (e.g., shooting).

Functionality:

Character Control: Players will use the pushbuttons to control the movement of their respective characters. One button will move the character to the left or right, and the other button will control the character's actions (shooting).

Game Objective: The game's objective is for the character with the gun to shoot the other character while the unarmed character attempts to avoid getting hit.

Shooting Mechanism: The character with the gun can "shoot" by pressing the corresponding button. This action results in a visual representation on the LCD, and the other player must use movement controls to evade being shot.

Scoring: Keep track of the score, with points awarded for successful hits or evasions. The LCD can display the current score for each player
